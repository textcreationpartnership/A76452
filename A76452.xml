         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The reaſon why man after the day of Judgement ſhall inherit all things,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155280:3"/> is this, becauſe the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> hath reſtored againe all that the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> loſt, for he is mighty to ſave, he is a Rocke and his worke is perfect, he <note place="margin">Iſa. 63. 1. Deut 32. 4. Joh. 17. 4. 19. 30. Heb. 7. 25.</note> hath not done his worke by the halves, he ſaith, <hi>I have finiſhed the worke that thou gaveſt me to doe,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> wherefore he is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt, ſo that all which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had, is reſtored by the ſecond, but the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was the Maſter-peece of the whole creation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man was the laſt that was made, and all the reſt were but prepared for him; and when man was to be made, the Lord did it with much delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and called a Councell, the whole Trinity ſeemed to conſult about his creation, ſaying, <hi>Let us make man in our likeneſſe, in our image, and let him</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note> 
               <hi>have dominion over the fiſh of the Sea, and over the fowle of the Aire, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every thing that creepeth upon the earth:</hi> And man is an Epitome or an Abridgement of all the creatures; he hath a vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or a growing life, anſwerable to the plants and the Herbes, and graſſe of the earth; and he hath a ſenſitive life, anſwerable to the beaſts, and fowles, and fiſhes; and he hath a reaſonable life, anſwerable to that of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: thus all the creatures are to be ſeene in man; he hath a ſoule ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, fit to aſſociate it ſelfe with the glorious Angels in Heaven, and he hath a body compounded of the foure elements, fit to communicate with and to governe the creatures here below: and when he was made, God bleſſed them, and ſaid unto them, <hi>Be fruitfull and repleniſh the earth, and ſubdue it, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 28.</note> 
               <hi>have dominion over the fiſh of the ſea, and over the fowle of the aire, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</hi> And when the Lord had formed all <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 19, 20.</note> the beaſts of the Field, and fowles of the ayre, he brought them all to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> as to their Lord, to ſee what he would call them, and whatſoever <hi>Adam</hi> called every creature that was the name thereof, and he gave names to all Cattle, and to the fowle of the aire, and to every beaſt of the field: thus they tendered their duty to him and were at unity among themſelves.</p>
            <p>But now ſince <hi>Adam</hi> fell from God, the creatures are diſobedient to man, ſaith the Lord to <hi>Job</hi> out of the whirlewinde, <hi>Will the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorne be willing to</hi>

               <hi>ſerve thee, will he harrow the valley after thee, wilt thou truſt him becauſe his ſtrength is great, or wilt thou leave thy labour to him, wilt thou beleeve that he will bring home thy ſeed, and gather it into thy Barne?</hi> or doth the Eagle flye at thy command? no, we find the creatures diſobedience to us, ſince our firſt diſobedience to the Lord.</p>
            <p>But to our comfort, the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> hath reſtored to us againe all that the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> loſt, and although we have not that duty and ſervice from the creatures, as <hi>Adam</hi> had at the firſt, by reaſon of their corruption, that came by our ſinne, yet after the day of Judgement, when they are freed from this bondage, under which they groane, and ſhall be reſtored to their firſt perfection, then they will freely doe their duty unto man as they ought to doe, but this will not be, till the reſtitution of all things, for he that ſate upon the Throne ſaid, <hi>Behold, I make all things new,</hi> then ſhall that ſaying <note place="margin">Rev. 24. 5.</note>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:155280:4"/> be fulfilled, <hi>Old things are paſſed away, behold all things are become new.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> And ſaith the Lord, <hi>Behold, I doe a new thing, now it ſhall ſpring forth, and ſhall ye not know it? I will make a way in the wilderneſſe, and rivers in the deſart;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa 43. 19.</note> and what followes; the beaſts of the field ſhall honour me, even the unlikelieſt of all the creatures, Dragons and Owles at that day.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why the creatures, as the Heavens and the earth, and all ſorts of creatures in them, ſhall be reſtored to their firſt perfection, is, becauſe they with man ſince the fall at their beſt eſtate are but vanity,<note place="margin">Pſal 39. 5. </note> ſo, <hi> Vanity of vanities, all is vanity, ſaith the Preacher:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1. 1.</note> For the creature was made ſubject to vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who ſubdued the ſame, but yet in hope and expectation to be delivered, for <hi>the whole creation groaneth in paine untill now, and not onely they, but we our ſelves alſo, which have received the firſt fruites of the Spirit, even we our ſelves groane, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our bodies.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 20. 22, 23.</note> The bondage which makes the creatures groane are many, from which in time they ſhall be delivered, I meane at the reſtauration of all things after the day of Judgement.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They are fraile and ſubject to corruption, and putrefaction, which came by the ſinne of man, this is a ſore bondage.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are ſubject to confuſions and inconſtancy in any one condition, as by the many mutations, and alterations appeares dayly, being compounded of the foure elements, and the many confuſions from the ſame foure elements; from this bondage they groane to be delivered.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They are forced to ſerve wicked men, The Sunne ſhines on the juſt and unjuſt, and the heavens make fruitfull with their ſhowers, the field of the wick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d as well as the field of the juſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 5 45.</note> and the earth is forced to feede and to receive into her bowels, the ungodly as well as the godly, this is a ſore bondage.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The viſible creatures of God proclaime as in a booke, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible things of God, as his eternall power, and God-head, to vaine men <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note> that will not learne; This is a ſore bondage for which they groane.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The creature is many times made the ſubject of mans puniſhment, for mans ſinne, as when the heaven is made Braſſe, and the earth Iron, <note place="margin">Deu. 28. 23 </note> and when the ground was curſed for mans ſinne,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 17, 18. </note> He turneth a fruitfull land into barrenneſſe for the wickedneſſe of them that dwell therein;<note place="margin">Pſa. 107. 34</note> this is a ſore bondage.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Every creature would preſerve his owne kind for ever, but the variance and diſcord of the creatures one with another make it to ſeeme unpoſſible, and all their labour to be loſt, this was occaſioned by the ſin of man, that all the foundations of the earth are out of courſe;<note place="margin">Pſa. 82. 5.</note> from this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, they groane to be delivered. </p>
            <p>Seventhly, It is a great bondage to the creatures, that they have loſt a great part of their vertue, operation, and influence, they are by the ſinne of man much dulled and diſabled to act or to operate, or to communicate
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155280:4"/> their vertues to others as they did at the firſt creation, and this is a great bondage, from which they groane to delivered, but this is true, that the <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 11, 12. Joh. 15. 15.</note> heavens wax old as a garment and as a veſture they ſhall be changed, and ſubject to periſh too for the ſinne of man, for that it hath defiled them. The heavens are not cleane in his ſight; and it is obſerved by ſome ſince the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Sun hath loſt a great part of its heate, and that it runnes nearer to the earth now then it did at the firſt, by at the leaſt 9976. Germane miles, <note place="margin">Byfield <hi>on the</hi> Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> which ſhewes the dulneſſe of it in compariſon of its firſt creation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without exception, the heaven and the earth with all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are in them as men and beaſts and fowles groane to be delivered.</p>
            <p>But I ſuppoſe that the Sea and the Creatures that live in it ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue after the day of judgement; for it is ſaid expreſly, when the new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the new earth are made, there ſhall be no more Sea; neither were the Fiſhes brought to <hi>Adam</hi> as to their Lord, to ſee what hee would call <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 1. Gen. 2. 19, 20. Gen. 1. 21.

            <p>And the bleſſed Angels I cannot include among the groaning creatures, yet they ſuſtaine a kinde of bondage, for they are made to ſerve earthly <note place="margin">Pſal. 91 11. Matth. 18. 10. Heb. 1. 14.</note> things, men have their Angels to attend and guard them, and it is thought they have the charge and protection of Kingdomes committed to them, from ſuch places as theſe in Scripture, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 13. 12. 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 7. <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 9, 10. 13. 15.

               <note place="margin">Dan. 10 13.</note> withſtood him one and twenty dayes; and although the Angels ſhall bee imployed at the day of judgement, yet they muſt not know when it muſt <note place="margin">Matth. 24. 31 36. 1 Pet. 1. 12. Ephe. 3. 10.

               <hi>we ſpeake;</hi> they ſhall be eaſed of that bondage.</p>

Thirdly, from Chriſt to the end of the world, in which all things may be eaten with thankeſgiving, &amp; nothing <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 3.

            <p>And againe the planting of the Goſpell, and increaſing or ſpreading of the Church may very well be called a Reſurrection, becauſe men were brought out of a ſtate of death to a ſtate of life, and the growth of the Church was like to the riſing of the waters of the ſanctuary, firſt to the <note place="margin">Ezekiel 47.</note> ankles, then to the knees then to the loynes, and to a river that could not be paſſed over, ſo was the Reſurrection of the Church, at the firſt but twelve, <note place="margin">Acts 1. 15. 2. 41. 44, 5 14.</note> then a hundred and twenty, then there was added three thouſand, then five thouſand, then multitudes both of men and women; now he that hath part in this firſt reſurrection, on them the ſecond death hath no power, and whether they have this firſt Reſurrection, in the firſt thouſand yeares, after Chriſts aſcenſion, or in the ſecond, it matters not, ſo they have it before the day of Judgement, on them the ſecond death hath no power: But our controverſie is about thoſe that were ſlaine for the witneſſe of Jeſus, and yet lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand yeares, but as I ſaid before, this cannot be meant of a corporall death, or bodily reſurrection, but it muſt be underſtood myſtically, that they were ſlaine in their outward livelihood, both in their name and eſtate; ſaith <hi>David,</hi> I was as a dead man out of mind in the eſteeme of the world, and yet at the ſame time reigne over ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and their owne corruptions.</p>
            <p>Or if any were ſlaine in the firſt thouſand yeares, yet God left not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe without witneſſe, but the more they afflicted them, the more they mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed <note place="margin">Acts 14, 17 Exod. 2. 12 Rev. 11.</note> and grew, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did in the bondage of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and ſome of the witneſſes that were ſlaine are ſaid to lye in the ſtreetes, and not ſuffered to be buryed, and after three dayes and a halfe, the Spirit of life came into them and they ſtood upon their feete, theſe things have beene clearely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of late to be underſtood myſtically. And againe, can we thinke that ſome of them that are dead, their ſoules ſhall return, &amp; ſome ſhall not, to live here a thouſand yeares, and their bodies raiſed, and not all? ſhall ſome riſe a thouſand yeares before others? doth not Chriſt ſay, they ſhall all riſe in one houre? <hi>Marvell not at this, for the houre commeth in which all that are</hi>

            <p>And whereas ſome affirme, that in this thouſand yeares, the Church or Kingdome of Chriſt, ſhall be all righteous, all Saints under the King of Saints, and no hypocrites, nor excommunicate perſons, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Revel. 15.</note> ſhall be as ſlaves to them in that day, and the Saints ſhall be as Lords in the earth, and ſhall neither marry nor be given in marriage, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſhall come and rule this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, theſe things ſome are falſe, and ſome are true, but miſ-apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thoſe that are true, are to be fulfilled after the day of Judgement, and not in this corrupted world, as when the people ſhall be all righteous, they ſhall inherit the Land, not onely a thouſand yeares, but for ever in the <note place="margin">Iſa. 60. 19, 20, 21.</note> new world when the Sunne ſhall no more goe downe, nor the Moone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw it ſelfe, but the Lord ſhall be to them an everlaſting light, and thy God thy glory. And ſo, if the Saints of the moſt High ſhall take and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the Kingdome.

For the Tares and the Wheate ſhall grow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther untill the Harveſt, which is at the end of the world, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are the Reapers, and by them ſhall the Wheate bee brought into the Barne, they ſhall gather the elect from the foure windes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31. And they ſhall gather out of his Kingdome all things that offend, and them <note place="margin">Math. 13. 41, 42.</note> that doe iniquity, and ſhall caſt them into the furnace of fire, but when the Angels are ſent about this buſineſſe, they will finde them altogether mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earthly things, as eating and drinking, and marrying, and mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <note place="margin">Mat. 24 37, 38.</note> two in a bed, the one taken and the other left, two in the field, and two grinding at the Mill, the one taken and the other left. Therefore, when Chriſt comes to Judgement, there ſhall be Hypocrites, and they ſhall not be uſed as ſlaves, but in the ſame bed, at the ſame worke and recreation together. And to ſay the Saints ſhall be Lords over the wicked, this cannot be true neither here nor hereafter, for before the end the wicked ſhall have as great a ſhare of outward riches and honour as the Saints, and many times greater: and after the day of Judgement, I ſhewed before that all things that offend, and that doe iniquity, ſhall be caſt into the furnace of fire: ſo that though it be true, they ſhall be Lords and Kings, it is not meant over wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, but over the reſt of the creatures, this <hi>Adam</hi> had, and loſt it, and <note place="margin">Revel. 5. 10</note>

            <p>I anſwer, the devils were bound in chaines of darkneſſe as ſoone as they had ſinned, <hi>For God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them downe to hell, and delivered them into chaines of darkneſſe.</hi> And if you aske me how long?

            <p>Here Chriſt did not bind the devill from going up and downe as a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lyon, ſeeking whom hee may devoure, and his commiſſion did reach <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 8.</note> to doe much hurt in this thouſand yeares to ſingle perſons, but the Devils purpoſe was to ſet up the man of ſinne, that myſtery of iniquity, that ſonne of perdition, the Antichriſt, in his Throne and full authority: this hee knew would make great ſpoyles in the Church of Chriſt, and the myſtery of iniquity did already worke, and <hi>Diotrephes</hi> loveth to have the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, <note place="margin">3 Joh. 9. 10</note> he prates againſt the miniſters of Chriſt with malicious words and would not receive them, and forbad others that would, and caſt them out of the Church.</p>
            <p>Here you ſee how buſie the devill is with this inſtrument to ſet up Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, becauſe he aimes not ſo much at ſingle perſons as the ruine of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from which he is bound a thouſand yeares: I grant that he raiſed great perſecutions and ſowed the tares of hereſies that did much miſchiefe, and occaſioned great warres, and made great ſpoyles in the Church, yet this did not content him, for he knew that Antichriſt was for to come, having great knowledge in the propheſies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which made him ſtirre ſo <note place="margin">Dan 7. 20, 21.</note> much, and cauſed his wicked inſtruments to bring in one patch of Popery after another, and would not reſt till hee had him in his throne, which was about a thouſand yeares before hee was in his full ruffe to doe that miſchiefe to the Church of God that the Devill expected hee ſhould.</p>
            <p>Now when this thouſand yeares was ended, there was a ſtarre fell from heaven unto the earth, and to him was given the key of the bittomleſſe pit, <note place="margin">Revel. 9. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> and he opened the bottomleſſe pit, and there aroſe the ſmoake of the pit, as the ſmoake of a great furnace, and the Sunne and the ayre was darkened by the ſmoake of the pit, and there came out of the ſmoake Locuſts upon the earth, and unto them was given power as the Scorpions of the earth have power, and it was commanded them that they ſhould not hurt the graſſe of the earth, nor any greene thing, nor any tree; but onely thoſe men which have not the ſeale of God in their foreheads, and to them was commanded, that they ſhould not kill them, but that they ſhould bee tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented or vexed five moneths, and that their paine ſhould bee as the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Scorpion when he ſtingeth and ſtriketh a man.</p>
            <p>Here you ſee the bottomleſſe pit that was ſhut, and the devill that was bound a thouſand yeares, now the pit is opened and the devils looſed,

            <p>If they ſay, none but the High Prieſt went into the Holy of Holies, ſo none but Chriſt, to heaven in his body &amp; ſoul, after his reſurrection, I anſwer, <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 24.</note> the beaſt that was ſacrificed, ſignifyed the body of Chriſt, and the Holyeſt of all was the figure of heaven, but the High Prieſt went in, and left the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice behind, and ſo did Chriſt goe into heaven it ſelfe, while his body <note place="margin">Luke 23. 43 46.</note> was ſacrificed, and lay in the earth, that day was he in Paradiſe; if this be not ſufficient to prove it, then marke his laſt words, Jeſus cryed with a

            <p>I anſwer, the way hath beene open from the beginning, although not made ſo manifeſt, for Chriſt was the Lambe ſlaine from the foundation of the world, and their faith before his viſible comming in the fleſh, gave ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 8.

I meane to that happineſſe prepared for them: but what makes <hi>Paul,</hi> deſire to depart and to be with Chriſt, Chriſt is not among the Starres, nor is he yet come in the clouds, that we <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23. 1 Theſſ. 4. 16, 17. 2 Cor. 5. 6, 8.</note> ſhould goe there to meete him, what makes him ſay, while we are in the body, wee are abſent from the Lord, and wee are willing rather to bee abſent from the body, that we may be preſent with the Lord; but if their ſoules after they depart ſhould be kept in a kind of purgatory, or priſon from the Lord Chriſt, they had as good be in the body ſtill, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Lord here, as there to be fruſtrate of our expectation, but the wicked ſhall be turned into hell, and the expectation of the poore Saints ſhall not periſh, their ſoule ſhall returne to God who gave it; as there is but <note place="margin">Pſal. 9. 17, 18.</note>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:155280:12"/> two wayes, ſo there is but two ends for all men good and bad, which are Heaven or Hell: ſaith Chriſt, In my Fathers houſe are many Manſions, if <note place="margin">Eccle. 12. 7</note> it were not ſo, I would have told you, that I go to prepare a place for you, But he will make knowne the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <note place="margin">John. 14. 2.

It may be <note place="margin">Phil. 1, 23.</note> ſome will after all this, rather then they will yeeld, that the ſoule departed is gone into the heaven of the bleſſed, they will ſay that it dies mortally with the body, but if they will beleeve Chriſt, that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> are living, they may be convinced of it; for God is the God of the living, and he is their God, they need not to feare them that kill the body, but cannot <note place="margin">Mar. 22. 32. Mat. 10. 28 Luke 2. 29.</note> kill the ſoule, the ſoule cannot dye with the body, but it departs away from it: Then I conclude, that if the Soule aſſoone as it leaves the body, goes immediately to Paradiſe, the third heaven, there is neither purgatory nor place of reſidence after death, but as the tree falleth ſo it lies, after death to Judgement; a particular ſentence is paſſed immediately upon them for heaven or hell, and there is no place of abode for <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, till they come into his boſome with him in Heaven for ever.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, which is the maine objection to all my former diſcourſe, if the ſoule of <hi>Abraham</hi> be in Heaven, and when he was here he deſired a better Country than this world, which is a heavenly, then they ſay after the day of Judgement, the Saints ſhall not inherit all theſe things here below in this world, becauſe the Saints did alwayes ſet a low value of them.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that the Soule is of a Heavenly ſubſtance, and when it <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 7.</note> leaves the body, then it hath ceaſed from ſinne, therefore no place between this and Paradiſe is fit to receive it. Therefore ſaith the Prophet, Ariſe ye and depart, for this is not your reſt, becauſe it is polluted: and after the <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 23.</note> day of Judgement, the Angels ſhall abide in Heaven, being a place for ſuch glorious Spirits, and the ſoules of men made perfect, being of the ſame nature with them, ſhall abide in Heaven alſo till the body ſhall riſe againe, for as the ſoules of men are now confin'd in Heaven, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 26. and the Angels have buſineſſe both in the Heavens and in the Earth, ſo after the day of Judgement, when they have finiſhed their worke in this world, they ſhall reſt, and I ſuppoſe ſhall be confined in Heaven for ever, and when our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies <note place="margin">Eccle 21. 7.</note> are riſen and united to our ſoules, then ſhall we inherit all things here in their firſt perfection, and alſo we ſhall have ſweet communion with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven: for as I ſaid before, man conſiſts of two parts, body and ſoule, ſo he ſhall have two worlds anſwerable to his two natures to delight himſelfe in, that he may have fulneſſe of joy for whom all things were made; <note place="margin">1 Tim 4. 8.</note> for godlineſſe is profitable unto all things, having promiſe of the life that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:155280:12"/> now is, and of that which is to come; and the meane time that the body lies in the grave, the ſoule is gone to take poſſeſſion of the kingdome of heaven, and when the body riſeth againe it ſhall then have this world beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and as the ſoule brought nothing with it, ſo it ſhall take nothing out with it, no not his owne body but leaves it here, in the earth till it comes againe, and ſo the body goes to the grave and takes nothing with it but weeping and mourning, yet when it comes againe, having had the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeeds of grace in it, ſhall doubtleſſe come againe with rejoycing, and <note place="margin">Pſal. 126. 6.</note> bring his ſheaves with him: ſo then after the day of judgement when all things are purified by fire, and reſtored to their firſt perfection, then I ſay man ſhall inherit all things, both in this world and in the world to come; then ſhall the meeke inherit the earth, and delight themſelves in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance <note place="margin">Pſal 37. 11.

            <p>But as the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the deſtruction of the world foretold in the Goſpell, are ſo infolded together that it is hard to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh one from the other, becauſe that in many things they doe ſo agree, <note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:155280:16"/> yet in ſome things they may be knowne: ſo the reſtauration of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or the calling of the <hi>Jewes</hi> doth ſo agree with that reſtauration of all things to the firſt perfection and the comming downe of that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 2.</note> that it is hard to diſtinguiſh the one from the other, yet in ſome things they may be knowne. I will here name ſome places of the Scripture which I ſuppoſe the promiſes are ſo mixed that they neither can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed before nor after, but partly before and partly after: it is ſaid, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall dwell in the Wilderneſſe, and righteouſneſſe remaine in the <note place="margin">Iſa. 32. 16, 17, 18.</note> fruitfull field, the worke of righteouſneſſe ſhall bee peace, and the effect of righteouſneſſe quietneſſe and aſſurance for ever; and my people ſhall dwell in a peaceable habitation, ſure dwellings and quiet reſting places: again, <note place="margin">Iſa. 33. 5, 6.</note> the Lord is exalted, for he dwelleth on high, he hath filled <hi>Zion</hi> with judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and righteouſneſſe, and wiſedome and knowledge ſhall be the ſtabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thy times, and ſtrength of ſalvation, the feare of the Lord is his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>But I ſuppoſe theſe precious promiſes are not to be fulfilled till after the day of Judgement, for which the ſinners in Sion are afraid, fearefulneſſe hath ſurpriſed the hypocrite; they ſay, who ſhall dwell with devouring fire? who can dwell with everlaſting burnings? <hi>ver.</hi> 14. the anſwer is made, he that walketh righteouſly, that ſpeaketh uprightly, he that deſpiſeth the gaine of oppreſſions, that ſhaketh his hands from holding of bribes, and ſtoppeth his eares from hearing of blood, and ſhutteth his eyes from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of evill, he ſhall dwell on high, his place of defence ſhall be the munition of Rockes, bread ſhall be given him, his waters ſhall be ſure, thine eyes ſhall ſee the King in his beauty, they ſhall behold the Land that is very farre off. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>But where is this land which theſe promiſes are of? looke unto Zion the City of of our ſolemnities; thine eyes ſhall ſee <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a quiet habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a Tabernacle that ſhall not bee taken downe, nor one of the Stakes thereof ſhall ever be removed, neither ſhall any of the coards thereof be broken, and the inhabitant ſhall not ſay, I am ſicke, the people that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their iniquity. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. and 24.</p>
            <p>Theſe things cannot be fulfilled in this world, for before the end all Churches are ſubject to ſinne, ſickneſſe, and alteration, and deſolation. But is this promiſe to the <hi>Jewes</hi> onely?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, No: Come neare ye Nations to heare, and hearken ye people: let the earth heare, and all that is therein, the world and all things that <note place="margin">Iſa. 34. 1.</note> come forth of it: here you ſee the extent of this promiſe is to all people and Nations, and not onely ſo, but to the earth and all creatures that come forth of it: Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beaſt of the field and every fowle of the ayre, and brought them unto <hi>Adam.</hi> All <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 19.</note> theſe have ſuffered a long time for the ſinne of man, but here is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for them; this is the ground of their hope and the earneſt expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 19.</note>

            <p>But ſhall this promiſe be fullfiled before the day of Judgement?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, No, for all the hoaſt of heaven ſhall be diſſolved, and the heavens ſhall be rouled together as a ſcroll, and all their hoaſt ſhall fall downe as the leafe falleth off from the vine, and as the falling figge from the figtree, for it is the day of the Lords vengeance and the yeare of recompences for the controverſie of <hi>Zion; verſ.</hi> 4. 8. then ſhall the wilderneſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart <note place="margin">Iſa 35 1.</note> bee glad for them, and the deſart ſhall rejoyce and bloſſome as a roſe, it ſhall bloſſome abundantly and rejoyce even with joy and ſinging, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Ver. 1, 2.</note> of <hi>Lebanon</hi> ſhall be given unto it, the excellency of <hi>Carmel</hi> and <hi>Sharon:</hi> they ſhall ſee the glory of the Lord and the excellency of our God; this may very well be underſtood to be after the day of Judgement, for your God will come with vengeance, even God with recompence, he will ſave you; <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>Then in what manner ſhall this ſalvation bee?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, from all bodily infirmities, there ſhall neither be blinde, nor lame, nor dumbe, nor deafe, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. but this cannot be fulfilled in this world before the end, till all the creatures are freed from the corruption that came in with ſinne; but that cannot be before the day of Judgement, for if ſinne were removed before the day of Judgement, that day ſhould never come, for God will not judge and condemne men where no ſinne is. Againe, they are not onely freed from infirmities, but from danger without.

            <p>And to ſay that Chriſt ſhall rule and governe as earthly monarches have done over this corrupted world before the day of judgement, in a worldly viſible and earthly glory, is but a fancy and cannot bee grounded upon the word of God, and the author of that booke that goes in the name of Mr. <hi>Archer,</hi> grants himſelfe, Page 5. that there is a world to come to bee put in ſubjection to Chriſt, of which <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocency was a type in many reſpects, firſt as hee damned all mankind, this was a type and figure of Chriſt ſaving all the elect,<note place="margin">Rom 5. 14. </note> and his marriage to the woman was a type of the conjunction of Chriſt to his Church,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 30, 31, 32.</note> and his ſoverainty over this preſent world was a figure of the ſubjection of the world to come to Chriſt, theſe things I grant, yet not before the day of judgement, becauſe the good and the bad are mixed together, and ſhall bee ſo till the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <note place="margin">Ioh 15. 15.</note> and becauſe all the creatures are corrupted by the ſinne of man, The heavens are not cleare in his ſight; and God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt,<note place="margin">Gen 6. 2.</note> for all fleſh had corrupted his way upon the earth,

Revel. 21. 23.</note> ſhall be there to inlighten it, ſo that in the Citie there will bee no neede of theſe things, yet out of the Citie the beaſts and fowles both ſtand in need of theſe things, therefore they ſhall be purified, that the reſt of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may have thoſe comforts belonging to them, and ſo they ſhall continue for ever, the light of the moone ſhall then bee as light as the Sunne, and the light of the Sunne ſhall be ſeven fold as the light of ſeven dayes, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the ſtroake of their wound; then ſhall the Sunne no more goe downe, neither ſhall the <note place="margin">Iſay 30. 26.</note> Moone withdraw it ſelfe, elſe the creatures would not be in ſo happy a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition under the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> in the new world, as they were in their creation <note place="margin">Iſay 60. 20.</note> under the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in the old world. The uſes follow.</p>
            <p>Firſt Uſe, hath Jeſus ſent his Angell to teſtifie theſe things unto the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? <note place="margin">Revel. 22. 16, 17. 20.</note> then let the Spirit and the bride ſay Come, and let him that heareth ſay come, and let him that is athirſt come, for hee that teſtifieth theſe things ſaith, ſurely I come quickly; even ſo come Lord Jeſus; there bee many benefits that come with Chriſt that may cauſe the Saints to deſire his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; there is a Crowne of righteouſneſſe which the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day, and not to me alone, but to all that love his appearing.

               <hi>up and lift up your heads, for your redemption draneth nigh; Let us rejoyce and be glad, and give honour to him, for the marriage of the Lambe is come, and his bride hath made herſelfe ready;</hi> becauſe it was revealed to old <hi>Simeon</hi> that hee ſhould not ſee death, till he had ſeene the Lords Chriſt, therefore he waited for the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> be patient therefore brethren unto the comming of our Lord, behold the husbandman waiteth for the fruite of the earth, be yee alſo pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, eſtabliſh your heart, for the comming of the Lord draweth nigh, ſaith <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">James 5. 7, 8. Micah 7. 7.</note> I will waite for the God of my ſalvation, and <hi>Paul</hi> commends the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> for this thing, for ſaith he, yee come behind in no gift, wayting for the comming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall confirme you unto the end, that ye may be blameleſſe in the day of our Lord, for ſaith he, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 7. 8.</note> is in heaven, from whence alſo we looke for the Saviour the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile bodies, and make them like unto his <note place="margin">Phil 3 20, 21.</note> glorious body, according to the working whereby hee is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelfe, Bleſſed is hee that waiteth and commeth to the 1335. dayes ſaith the Angel to <hi>Daniel,</hi> but go thou thy way, thou ſhalt reſt till the end <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 12, 13.</note> be, and then ſtand in thy lot in the end of the dayes when all things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to their firſt perfection, then <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhall have his lot among other Saints; therefore waite I ſay on the Lord, I will waite for the Lord, my ſoule doth waite, in his word doe I waite, My ſoule doth waite for the Lord, more then they that watch for the morning, I ſay more then they that watch for <note place="margin">Pſal. 130.</note> the morning; let <hi>Iſrael</hi> hope in the Lord, watch therefore, for ye know not at what houre your Lord doth come, therefore be yee ready, for in ſuch an <note place="margin">Matth. 24. 42. 44. 46. 47.</note> houre as yee thinke not of the Sonne of man commeth; bleſſed is that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant whom his Lord when hee commeth ſhall finde ſo doing, verily I ſay unto you hee will make him ruler over all his goods, now what are thoſe goods that the Saints ſhall bee made Rulers over at the day of judgement, but thoſe creatures that were given to the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and hee by his ſinne loſt this Lordſhip over them, and the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> hath reſtored to him all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in their firſt perfection, and ſaith <hi>Luke,</hi> hee will make him ruler over his <note place="margin">Luke 12. 42. 44.</note> houſehold and over all that he hath; now ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, of whom the whole family in heaven and <note place="margin">Ephe. 3 14. 15.</note> earth is named, what other meaning can this have but this after the day of judgement, to be made Lords and Rulers over all the creatures here below, and as I take it in ſome degree alſo above the Angels in heaven? howſoever here is ſufficient to anſwer a queſtion ſometimes moved, which is this, whether <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> ſhall the Saints or Angels have the higheſt degree of glory after the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I anſwer the Saints, for as the beaſts ſhall be confined to the earth, ſo <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the Angels ſhall be confined in heaven, but man ſhall inherit all things, all things I ſay both in earth and heaven, and as man ſhall have more glory on
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:155280:20"/> earth then any beaſt or fowle can have, ſo I ſuppoſe he ſhall have more glory in heaven then any Angel there, becauſe that he is the maſter piece of all, and as it were a modell of all the creation, being the laſt that was made, all the reſt being but made for him; the Elders were with Chriſt on the throne, and the Angels ſtanding round about it, read <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. 11. therefore in more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Revel. 5. 11 7. 11.</note> then the Angels.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Vſe may teach us admiration with <hi>David,</hi> and ſay, O how great is thy goodneſſe which thou haſt laid up for them that feare thee, which thou <note place="margin">Pſal. 31. 19.</note> haſt wrought for them that truſt in thee before the ſonnes of men!</p>
            <p>Firſt, Looke backe upon ſinne and ſee the curſed nature of it, and admire at the filthy contagion of it that hath defiled the lower heavens and the earth <note place="margin">Iob 15. 15. Gen 6. 12.</note> and all creatures in them and ſpoyled the glory and beauty of them all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This may teach us to admire at the great mercy and goodneſſe <note place="margin">Pſal. 136. 23. 72. 12. Pſal. 63. 5.</note> of our God who remembred us in our low eſtate, how he delivered us when we had no helper, he looked and there was none to helpe, then his owne Arme brought ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Here we may admire at the folly of <hi>Adam</hi> that would hazzard ſuch a glorious world of creatures and loſe them all for a bit of an Apple.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, we may admire at their happy and permanent condition under the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> when as they ſhall bee eſtabliſhed for ever, and ſee how fickle and mutable they were under the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> O then happy is he that is not under the firſt but under the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who hath reſtored againe what the firſt loſt.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, here we may admire at the great price of our redemption, the worth and value of the blood of Chriſt, when we had ſpoyled and ruined the whole <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 19</note> creation, all the glorious workes of God by our ſinnes, that the blood of Chriſt ſhould purchaſe redemption for mankind, and eſtabliſhment to the Angels that had not ſinned, and purification to the creatures here below, and eſtabliſhment to all.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, here we may ſee and admire at the juſtice of God to all, that creatures that have ſuffered puniſhment, not for their owne ſins but for ours, now they ſhall not onely be delivered after ſo long a time, but eſtabliſhed in an unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition for ever, which will make amends for their great loſſe they had by the ſinne of man.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, admire at the wiſedome of God that could finde out ſuch a way to ſatisfie his owne juſtice and yet to ſave his creatures.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, this may teach us to admire at the power of God that is able to doe all theſe things, which in all mens judgement was a greater worke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the ruins of the old world, then it was at the firſt to make it of nothing, he travelled in the greatneſſe of his ſtrength, and is mighty to ſave, he layd <note place="margin">Iſay 63. 1. Pſal. 89. 19 Pſal. 33. 9.</note> helpe upon one that is mighty whereas the world was made by a word of command, He ſpake and it was done, he commanded and it ſtood faſt.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, this may teach us to admire at the great love of God to us, in not ſparing his owne Sonne, but gave him up to death for us all. <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note>
            </p>
            <p>10. Admire at the great love of Chriſt, for when wee were yet without <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 68</note>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:155280:21"/> ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly, God commended his love to us in that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us.</p>
            <p>11. Admire at Gods free acceptation of Chriſts atonement and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when he became our ſurety, ſaith he, behold my Servant whom I have <note place="margin">L 2 Heb. 7. 22. F Mat 12. 18, I 20, 21. 2</note> choſen, my beloved in whom my ſoule is well pleaſed, I will put my Spirit upon him and he ſhall ſhew Judgement to the Gentiles he ſhall ſend forth judgement unto victory, and in his name ſhall the Gentiles truſt.</p>
            <p>12. Admire at the faithfulneſſe of God the father to God the ſonne in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to Chriſt all the elect, and of the Sonne to the Father that will loſe none of them that the Father, gave him before Chriſt came in the fleſh, the Father gave Chriſt all the elect and ſet him a day to pay for the purchaſe, and now it is payed, the Sonne truſts the Father for all the elect as they fall in their ſeverall ages of the world.</p>
            <p>The third uſe, Is it ſo that all things ſhall be reſtored againe to the Saints in their firſt perfection? then let us not ſo much labour for them in their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted condition, as to have them perfect at the day of Judgement, let us uſe them to Gods glory in giving to relieve the poore, and behold all things are cleane <note place="margin">Luk. 11. 41</note> unto you, unto the pure all things are pure; that is, he hath not onely a pure and a ſanctified uſe of them here, but they ſhall be reſtored to their firſt puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 15.</note> after the day of Judgement; let us not deſire them immoderately in their corrupted condition, nor to get them unjuſtly by fraud or deceit, nor unjuſtly poſſeſſe them by keeping them to our ſelves, when the Lord calls for them for publicke uſes, neither be thou envious at the fooliſh, when thou ſeeſt the proſperity of the wicked: There is a ſore evill which I have ſeene under the <note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 1. 7 3. 3. Eccleſ 5. 13 Verſ. 10. 1 Tim. 6. 17. Prov. 23. 5. 1 Pet. 5. 7. Heb. 10. 34 Prox. 8. 18</note> Sun, namely, riches kept to the hurt of the owners; theſe things in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted condition will not ſatisfie us, he that loveth ſilver ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſilver, nor he that loveth abundance with increaſe; and they are but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine riches, truſt not in them but in the living God who giveth us all things richly to enjoy, then ſet not thine heart upon that which is not, for riches make themſelves wings and fly away as an Eagle toward heaven, caſt your care upon God, for he careth for you, the Saints in former times could ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with joyfulneſſe the ſpoyling of their goods, becauſe they had a better and an induring ſubſtance, let us labour for wiſedome, and that will bring with it durable riches and righteouſneſſe, and her merchandiſe, and her hire ſhall be holineſſe to the Lord, it ſhall not be treaſured up, for her merchandiſe ſhall be before them that dwell before the Lord to eate ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently <note place="margin">Iſa 23. 28.

Firſt ſeek the Kingdome of God, and all theſe things ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto you, if not in this world, yet they ſhall in their purity and firſt perfection be reſtored at the laſt day; Feare not little flocke, it is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdome. Here might be a uſe of comfort to the poore Saints of God, who have but little of theſe outward things, let them not be diſcouraged, for all is theirs as ſoone as the droſſe and corruption is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from them, for they are like unto men that waite for their Lord, if you be found ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you ſhall be bleſſed and made rulers over all that he hath: when the curſe is taken from the earth, and in ſtead of the thorne ſhall come up the firre tree, and in ſtead of the bryer ſhall come up the firre tree, this ſhall be to the Lord for a name and for an everlaſting ſigne that ſhall not be cut off, for ye ſhall goe forth with joy and be led forth with peace: the mountaines and hills ſhall breake forth before you into ſinging, and all the trees of the field ſhall clap their hands, his honour have all the Saints, praiſe ye the Lord. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149. 9.</p>
